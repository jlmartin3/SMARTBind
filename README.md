# SMARTBind

This is fork of the SMARTBind model created by Jiang et all (2025). SMARTBind is a sequence-based RNA-ligand interaction prediction 
method by leveraging contrastive learning and RNA foundation model. It can be used for RNA-ligand interaction virtual screening
and binding site prediction for the potential ligand binders.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIDD-LiLab/SMARTBind.git
cd SMARTBind
```

### Install Required Packages
To install the required packages, run the following command:
```bash
# cuda 12.4 is required to satisfy the torch version
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate SMARTBind_env
```

## Inference with SMARTBind
Downloaded pretrained SMARTBind models from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17254230). 
An alternative way is to use `gdown` as follows if you are working in a server without browser access:
```bash
mkdir SMARTBind_weight
cd SMARTBind_weight
gdown --id 1z0PD0CRMAs1Q43g836JMzh0VFcAcoG-l
unzip SMARTBind_weight.zip
rm SMARTBind_weight.zip
```

Please refer to the `notebook/README.md` for the details of the inference with SMARTBind model using jupyter
notebooks.
